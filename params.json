{"name":"Pulsewaves","tagline":"An IDL implementation of PulseWaves","body":"PulseWaves\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis project is an IDL implementation of PulseWaves version is 0.3 (revision 9) created by Antoine Cottin.\r\n\r\nCarbomap has a joint expertise of more than ten years in lidar full waveform data processing (bathymetric and topographic lidar).\r\n\r\nCarbomap takes a step forward, and fully support PulseWaves file format and integrates its support to all of its workflows.\r\n\r\nAs we want PulseWaves file format to be broadly accepted by the users community, we are releasing an open source IDL library to read and write PulseWaves file. We hope preliminary work will be the ground base to a wide users community effort to develop more tools that will profite to everyone.\r\nSo don't hesitate to clone and/or fork this project. We want and need you to be involve.\r\n\r\nPulseWaves is a Vendor neutral full waveform data format created by Martin Isenburg (RapidLasso) that is retro-compatible with LAS file.\r\nThe C++ source code and format specification can be found on GitHub at:\r\nhttps://github.com/PulseWaves\r\n\r\nFor convinency to any IDL developer and for testing, we are hosting the same demo data and the file format specifications available on Martin's github page.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\nAntoine\r\n-----------------------\r\nCreated 02/03/2014 by Antoine Cottin\r\nCarbomap Ltd.\r\n7th Floor, Appleton Tower\r\n11 Crichton Street\r\nEdinburgh\r\nEH8 9LE\r\nhttp://www.carbomap.com\r\nhttp://carbomap.wordpress.com\r\nhttp://github.com/carbomap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
